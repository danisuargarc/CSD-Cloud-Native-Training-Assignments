This directory consists of assignments completed for the Spring Core module of my Custom Software Development training, specifically in Cloud Native.

These programs do not perform error handling as the main focus was to understand and implement software concepts.

All questions/prompts are in their respective .java files' Javadoc.

The .java files are in /src/main/java/spring/core/assignment/.
The dbConfig.properties file is in /src/main/resources/.
The .xml files are in /src/main/java/.
